# Transformer Model Tutorial

Welcome to the Transformer model tutorial! This repository contains a detailed guide on how to build a Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch. The tutorial is based on the groundbreaking paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al., which introduced the Transformer architecture revolutionizing natural language processing tasks.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Guide**: Step-by-step instructions to build a Transformer model.
- **From Scratch Implementation**: Learn how each component of a Transformer is implemented in PyTorch.
- **Interactive Notebook**: A [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) is included for interactive learning and experimentation without needing any local setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need a basic understanding of Python and neural networks. Familiarity with PyTorch and natural language processing (NLP) concepts is helpful but not required.

### Run on Google Colab

To make it easy for everyone to run and experiment with the model, a Colab notebook is provided. Simply click on the link below to open the notebook in your browser and follow the instructions:
